# LichessReQuote

Have you ever been bothered by the fact that on Lichess there are such boring quotes under the arenas? This browser extension replaces them with more interesting (not necessarily real) quotes.

## Versions

### Firefox

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/lichessrequote/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Firefox_logo%2C_2019.svg/800px-Firefox_logo%2C_2019.svg.png" width=75></a>

### Chrome

I was quite bummed out to discover that Google makes you pay 5$ to publish anything on the chrome web store, and more importantly only allows credit cards, which forces you to connect your real identity to your google account. If anyone has a developer account on the chrome web store, feel free to publish it.

You can still use the plugin by downloading it here and then dragging and dropping the Chrome folder onto the Addons page in Chrome.


## Bugs and Questions

If you have questions, have found bugs, or you have suggestions for new quotes, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/HorseyGoBrrr/LichessReQuote/issues).
